# Introduction

**Cap Collectif** is a french start up that aims at supporting decision-makers who want to change their decision-making process towards more transparency and inclusion.
To do that, we provide decision-makers with a **fully customizable online platform** integrating **10 different tools**, each dedicated to a specific **participatory process** (consultation, which aims at setting up debates in a controlled and organized framework, participatory budgeting, survey, call for proposals, suggestion box, etc.).
Our technology is based on a collective intelligence methodology inspired by the Open Gov’s doctrine created by Barack Obama — and since adopted by 79 countries in the world — in order to reinforce the efficiency of public policies and rebuild citizens’ trust.
